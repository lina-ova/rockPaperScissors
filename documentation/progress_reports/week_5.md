# Week 5

This week centered around refining prediction logic and engaging in collaborative review. I dove deeper into the Markov chain model, ensuring that prediction logic was solid. I also spent time reviewing a colleague's project, offering insights and feedback.

## 1. **Markov Chain Prediction Logic:**

Developed and refined the prediction logic for the Markov chain model.
Updated tests to ensure accuracy and functionality.

## 2. **Project Review:**

Analyzed a peer's project, providing constructive feedback and observations.
Engaged in discussions about possible improvements and innovations.
