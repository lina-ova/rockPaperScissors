# Week 3

This week was focused on solidifying the foundation of the MultiAi class and preparing it to interconnect diverse Markov Models, depending on their predictive accuracy and performance. The endeavor was not only to structure the components for future implementations but also to enhance the development environment by integrating essential tools and creating comprehensive documentation.

## 1. **MultiAi Class Development:**
   - Significant efforts were invested in the meticulous crafting of the MultiAi class. The role of this class is crucial, serving as an intelligent agent that can assess and select the most efficient Markov Model to predict the subsequent user moves in the Rock-Paper-Scissors game. While the class is framed to make selections, the predictive logic within the Markov Models is still under development.

## 2. **Structural Provisioning for Markov Models:**
   - Although the Markov Models are yet to gain predictive capabilities, a streamlined structural framework has been laid out within the `Game` and `MarkovModel` classes. This approach is to ensure seamless integration and enhancements of the models in the upcoming stages of the project.

## 3. **Integration of Continuous Integration & Linting:**
   - To maintain code quality and adherence to established coding standards, Pylint was integrated into the project both locally and in the CI pipeline. This implementation guarantees that the project remains robust, maintainable, and aligned with best practices.

## 4. **Focused Documentation:**
   - This week, a strong emphasis was placed on creating exhaustive documentation. Comprehensive documentation was developed for both local testing of the program and viewing the coverage report online. These documents serve as invaluable resources for understanding the testing framework and the reporting structure, aiding in both development and review processes.

## 5. **Deferring UI Testing:**
   - UI testing has not been performed yet due to its intrinsic complexity. 


## Next Steps:
1. **Implementing Prediction Logic:**
   - Develop and integrate predictive logic within the `MarkovModel` class to enable accurate predictions of user moves.
   
2. **Optimizing the MultiAi Class:**
   - Refine and optimize the MultiAi class for precise and optimal model selection based on real-time performance assessment.
   
3. **Conducting Extensive Testing:**
   - Create and execute a suite of extensive tests to validate the reliability and accuracy of the implemented components and their interactions.
   
6. **Performance Evaluation:**
   - Perform rigorous evaluations of the Markov Models and the intelligent selector to affirm the effectiveness and accuracy of the system.
