# Week 1

This week involved a blend of theoretical exploration and practical implementations. I explored Markov chains, delved into AI advancements through an article on "Multi AI", and developed frontend features and a simple game algorithm.

## 1. Markov Chains:
- Familiarized with its principles and applications.

## 2. AI Reading:
- Reviewed the "Multi AI" article, understanding the integration of multiple AIs for enhanced performance.

## 3. Frontend Login Feature:
- Designed and manually tested a user-friendly login UI.

## 4. Rock-Paper-Scissors Algorithm:
- Created a basic game where the computer randomly chooses one of the three options.
