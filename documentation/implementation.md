# Implementation

The program is divided into three primary modules:

1. **Game Logic:** This module defines the core logic of the game, including determining the winner based on the choices of the player and the AI. 

2. **Markov Model:** This module includes the logic for predicting the next move of the player using the Markov chain model.

3. **UI (User Interface):** Built using the `tkinter` library, this module provides a graphical interface, allowing the player to interact with the game in a visual manner.


## Time and Space Complexities

Yet to evaluate

## Possible Shortcomings and Improvement Suggestions

**Vulnerability of the Markov Model:** While the Markov model can be efficient under certain circumstances, it can be vulnerable if a player identifies the model and starts producing random moves.



## Utilization of Large Language Models

OpenAI's ChatGPT has been used to enhance the readability of documentation and provide clearer comments within the code.
